' ======
'
' Default implementations of Map and Bind for different structures. Classes
' that implement `Map`, or `Bind` (aka `FlatMap`), can avoid code duplication
' by using these functions with their predeclared object as `seed`.

' defIterable, defTransversable etc...

' -------------
'
' Transversable maps use `For Each` structures to loop over the sequence. Since
' mutliple data-types can use `For Each` the squence is a Variant.

' These will be the most commonly used.
